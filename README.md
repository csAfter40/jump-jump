## Jump Jump

Jump Jump is a vertical endless platformer game written in Python using the Pygame module. The aim is to achieve the highest score by reaching higher platforms and collecting coins.

### Here are some facts about game mechanics:
* The player can jump higher by holding down the jump key for a longer duration.
* The player can shoot bullets to eliminate enemies.
* Platforms become shorter as the player progresses in the game.
* Some platforms move from side to side on the screen.
* There are three types of platforms: grass, sand, and ice.
* The game starts with grass platforms, which are easy to move and jump on.
* Sand platforms appear later, slowing down the player's movement and reducing their jump height.
* Finally, ice platforms are introduced. The player slips on ice platforms, making it the most challenging type to navigate.
* There are two kinds of power-ups available: high jump and extra ammo.
* The high jump power-up enables the user to jump almost twice as high as the normal jump, but it is only available for a limited period of time.

### Installation and running the game:
1. You need to install Pygame module:
```pip install pygame```
2. Navigate to the game directory and run the following command:
```python main.py```

Please note that the instructions assume you have Python and pip installed on your system.
